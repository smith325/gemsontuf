# Place holder script for creating a new delegation bin.
#
# A delegate bin is a collection of packages stored in the
# same container, called the bin.  This script should generate
# all of the delegation roles needed to break up all of the GEM
# packages into a smaller number of 'bins' which will contain both
# the GEM package data as well as the metadata for all GEMs in
# the bin.
